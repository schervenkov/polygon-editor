This is a simple tool for drawing polygons to use with pixi.js (for defining polygon hitArea, drawing polygons, etc.)
It's made from one of the demos of gojs library: https://gojs.net/2.0.21/extensions/PolygonDrawing.html and is modified to export the data in pixi friendly format.
There's also added an option to add background image, so you can draw the shape over this image.

The tool is available here: https://chalgoman.github.io/polygon-editor/
